## Status

This plugin is still in the **early stages of development** so only has a handful of features. But over time things will stabilize and more features will be added. Currently 
only the lexer and some very basic syntax highlighting are done - see screenshot below.
 
 
## Usage

Visit [intellij-crystal.github.io] to find documentation about installation and features.

* Initial syntax highlighting

* Initial AST tree for parser / grammar

## Roadmap

To track the progress [see the agile board here](https://tzatziki.io/b/zbcwdZLjAZa8wQdxX/intellij-crystal)

The following features will evolve over the next few months:

* full lexer - with tests
* full grammar parser - with tests
* default syntax highlighting color scheme - based on Atom light theme
* darcula syntax highlighting color scheme - based on Atom dark theme
* working commenter
* Go to definition
* jump to implementation
* refactor - rename

Features for later on:

* crystal intellij project type
* compiler support and run configurations
* code formatting
* code auto completion

## Releases

* An initial alpha release with just the lexer and basic syntax highlighting is in the [Jetbrains plugin repo](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10213-crystal-language-plugin)
* Hopefully there will be a release every few months going forward
